MyFitnessPal is seeking 300 or so users of our Android app to participate in a public beta test of our Android version 3.6.
We're seeking active users of the app who would like to test new features before we release our next update. If youve beta-tested the Android app for us before, and would like to continue, please let us know by re-applying via the link below.

Participants should be willing to:
a) provide feedback around new features
b) provide information about bugs or other issues they encounter
c) take some technical steps on their device to provide debugging logs to our developers

If you're comfortable with those items, please fill in the beta enrollment form here: https://docs.google.com/a/myfitnesspal.com/forms/d/1bU-sey5JiyPRGlV0LRXm7KAQZB8DNdPP771LHESYXGI/viewform#start=openform
We will take this post down and close the enrollment form when we have enough volunteers. If we close the beta before you are able to sign up, please try again next time!
Thanks so much,
The MyFitnessPal Team
